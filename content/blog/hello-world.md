Welcome to my blog! This is my first post, and I'm excited to start sharing my thoughts here.

## Why a blog?

I've always believed that writing is one of the best ways to learn. When you try to explain something in writing, you quickly discover the gaps in your understanding.

This blog is my space to:

- **Think out loud** — working through ideas by writing about them
- **Share what I'm learning** — from code to books to life
- **Build in public** — documenting the process, not just the outcome

## What to expect

I'll be writing about a mix of topics — software engineering, books I'm reading, projects I'm building, and whatever else I find interesting.

Stay tuned, and thanks for stopping by!
